## Problem
Manual parking enforcement in Lot 59 is slow, costly, and error-prone.  
**Goal:** Automate license plate detection and classification of registered vs unregistered vehicles.

---

## Method
- **Detection:** YOLOv8 for plate localization  
- **OCR:** PaddleOCR for character recognition  
- **Integration:** Matching plates against a registration list  
- **Deployment Concept:** Camera-mounted enforcement cart for real-time alerts

## Results
- Plate detection accuracy â‰¥ 95%  
- OCR accuracy â‰¥ 92%  
- Registered vs unregistered classification â‰¥ 90%  
- 70% reduction in manual patrol time  

---

## Business Impact
- Faster, more consistent parking enforcement  
- Reduced labor costs  
- Scalable across other ASU lots and potentially other universities
